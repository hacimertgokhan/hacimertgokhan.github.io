                    <p class="colorized-green-text">I made a password generator with Python, started recoding my own Discord bot, and discovered a few plugins that I can use on my discord bot minecraft server. I'm trying to optimize my rank plugin, which is currently in the project phase, for my server. I plan to make my rank plugin available to the whole world if I successfully complete the transaction..</p>
