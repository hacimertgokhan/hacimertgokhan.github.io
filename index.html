                            <p>Currently, I am developing myself in the java language. As an extra, I also fill my free time with html and css, I have fun.</p>

                            <p>Then I started learning the Pyhton language. It was an extremely funny language. I could do almost anything. Why haven't I tried something so beautiful before?</p>

                            <p>Discord.i have used more than one bot in the js language, my most used bot was Mixer bot, but mixer bot was banned due to a software error. Mixer bot had 8k instant users and 76 servers.</p>

                            <p>Software is where my life began. I can say that I started with a very simple language, but I really had a lot of fun. "Why don't I try better ones too" Discord afterwards.i started js language.</p>
