# Information:
This website example is coded by Hacı Mert Gökhan (Mixeration). Please do not try to make the codes here look like your own. Or don't promote the project as your own. Otherwise, necessary actions will be taken.

# About:
I will add new features to the website day by day. I don't know exactly when I will finish. A very simple example and a good value for beginners.
