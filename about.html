                    <p>Hello, my name is Mert. I'm 16 years old and I live in Turkey. I like anime, animals, reading books, mythologies and coffee.I l​ove writing code, and I think I'll keep it for the rest of my life. I do add-ons that I do for free without a fee.
                        I wanted to try many things until I was 16, one of them was software. I thought it was simple like on TV, but it wasn't like that at all. I love software and I want to keep it for the rest of my life. Besides, I love science books too much. I take Nikola Tesla, one of my favorite scientists, as an example, and Elon Musk as my idol. I enjoy trying again and again when I fail at something!</p>    
                    <p>Here is my <a href="https://github.com/mixeration">GitHub</a> page, you can find lot of source code ! </p>

                                I did it for my German performance homework. With Tkinter, a window is created and each time you press the button, it selects a word and displays it on the screen. It is up to you to translate this word into Turkish..</p>
